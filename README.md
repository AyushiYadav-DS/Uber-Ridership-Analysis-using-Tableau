# Uber-Ridership-Analysis-using-Tableau
This project analyzes Uber ridership data to identify key patterns in ride requests, incomplete ride factors, and the supply-demand relationship. The analysis provides insights into peak demand periods, reasons for ride failures, and how driver availability affects ride fulfillment.

**OBJECTIVE**
The analysis aims to uncover patterns in Uber ridership based on the following key questions: <br>
>> Identifying Peak Demand Hours – Determine major time slots when ride requests are highest. <br>
>> Understanding Factors Behind Incomplete Requests – Analyze cancellation and "No Cars Available" cases to find trends. <br>
>> Exploring the Supply-Demand Relationship – Compare ride requests with completed rides to assess supply shortages. <br>


**Dataset Information**
The dataset contains the following details:
1) Request ID – Unique ID for each ride request
2) Date – Date when the ride was requested
3) Request Time – Time when the ride was requested
4) Dropoff Time – Time when the ride was completed
5) Pickup Point – Customer’s pickup location
6) Driver ID – Unique identifier for the assigned driver
7) Status – Status of the ride (Completed, Cancelled, or No Cars Available)

**Insights**
1) Peak demand occurs during specific time slots (e.g., morning/evening rush hours).
2) Ride failures are influenced by high demand, low driver availability, and pickup location.
3) Supply-demand mismatches are identified, helping in resource allocation strategies.

**Conclusion**
The analysis helps in understanding Uber’s operational challenges and provides insights into optimizing driver allocation and improving service availability during peak hours.
